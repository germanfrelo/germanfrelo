Hi! I'm **Germán**, a **front-end** web developer with **1** year of experience developing websites and web apps (e-commerce). I live in Murcia (Spain).

I'm passionate about web technologies, specially about the visual part: layout, UI/UX and Design Systems.

The technologies and tools in which I have experience are:

- Semantic HTML.
- CSS, Sass (SCSS) and methodologies such as BEM and CUBE CSS.
- JavaScript (ES6+), React.js and Next.js.
- Cypress for E2E testing.
- Version control: Git and GitHub.

On my personal website [**germanfreixinos.com**](https://germanfreixinos.com) I have my portfolio, where I continually update the projects as I improve and acquire new knowledge. I'm also on [**CodePen**](https://codepen.io/germanfrelo) and [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/germanfrelo).

I am always learning, and I frequently read the latest news about the industry and about my stack. I'm **currently** improving my knowledge of React thanks to the online course "**The Joy of React**", by Josh W Comeau. I will be linking the projects here and on my website. I will also start learning **Figma** for design soon.

I also have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Electronic Engineering at Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT).

I am a native **Spanish** speaker, I have a B2 level in **English**, and a basic level of **French**.
